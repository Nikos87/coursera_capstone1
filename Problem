In Greece, the nightlife is wild and most night clubs that stay open until the sunrise. Along with the clubs there are usually fast food restaurants open the same hours, since after a drinking night, most people seek something to eat before going home. The Business Problem I created has to do with finding a good spot to open such a fast food restaurant, specifically a creperie. This project works for the southern suburbs of Athens (capital of Greece) and finds all the night clubs that can boost the income of a 24-hour fast food restaurant and all the already existing creperies (possible antagonists). Changing the location and the boost/antagonist name this algorithm can be beneficial for anyone who seeks to open a new restaurant with familiar criteria.
